***Growth Mindset***

Possessing a growth mindset is an extremely helpful tool in both your personal and professional life. In the face of challenges and adversity, a growth mindset will help you move forward and learn from experiences in a healthy manner. A growth mindset, in my book, is a mixture of perseverance, resilience, adaptability, and the love of learning.  

### Reminders to keep a growth mindset:
- When things seem to be going downhill, take a few breaths and observe the situation before making any decisions or not.
- When you catch yourself feeling jealous or envious of someone's success, practice telling yourself that you are happy for them and that you're inspired by their work.
- Take care of yourself and decrease stressors so you can upkeep a growth mindset.
