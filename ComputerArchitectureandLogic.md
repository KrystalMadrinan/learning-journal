# Computer Architecture and Logic

### ***Basic makeup of a computer***

- What makes a computer? every computer has an input, CPU, and output.
- Computers still use binary (0's and 1's) but it would take humans forever to write this so we use software now.
- Tiny circuits are faster (such as in cell phones) because it takes less time for stuff to travel than in a computer the size of a room.

### ***All About Loops***

-  Loops check a condition! They work a lot with booleans(true or false).
- FOR Loops
    + If you need to run the code a specific NUMBER of times, use a for loop. (check out class 8 slides for visuals!! Textbook too). 
    + `for(var i = 0; i < var count; i++) {
        document.write(i);
    }`
- WHILE Loops
    + You use while loops if you don't know how many times a code should run. An example would be what we did in class today - the question would keep popping up until we answer it. 
- In general, loops continue to run until the condition is false - or else it can go to infinity which means something is broken.
- DO WHILE Loops
