# Structuring Webpages Using HTML
  This assignment is focusing on the process of using HTML5, since that's what we use now, not div style. 
## ***Notes to keep in mind:***
- You don't capitalize in html besides DOCTYPE. You can, but don't.
- Adding comments in html looks like this: <~!-- this is a comment--~> (w/o the squigglies)
- The index.html is always your homepage, your root page.  
- An attribute is used to identify one element from another. They are located within opening tags. 
- Example on how to multiply something: section>article>*3
- Main is a component of the body.
