# Notes on Programming with Javascript thus far

### ***Intro and Scripts***

- 

### ***Expressions and operators***

- Expression: evaluates a value
    * Type one: `var color = 'blue';` (1:1)
    * Type two: `var area = 9 * 9;` This returns a single value, not just numbers but work with strings as well. 
- Operators: There are several different types of operators, such as arithmetic and assignment.
    * Arithmetic operator examples: +, -, % (this one divides then returns the remainder). 
    * String operator is a plus symbol. `+`
    * Example: `var firstName = 'Krystal';`
                `var lastName = 'Madrinan';`
                `var fullName = firstName + lastName;`
    * Refer to resources for more on operators and expressions. 

### ***Functions***

- Functions are basically statements that help perform a task. Sometimes a function stores said task until something is done on a webpage to activate it - like clicking somewhere on the page. 
- *Calling/invoking a function means to perfrom the task.*
- **A _parameter_ is a piece of information passed to a function, which helps with the task.** 
- The response when you call a function is called a **return value**.
