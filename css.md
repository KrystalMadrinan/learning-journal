# Notes on CSS thus far

### ***General CSS Info***

- CSS has its own file, with the extension .css
- An inline CSS element is within the text.
- A selector indicates which element in HTML a rule apploes to.
- The declaration actually says how the elment should be styled. 
- Within declarations, you have property: value 
    * e.g, color: blue 
- There are so many types of selectors, but you can always google them.
- You can create rules that can override elements when concerned with the last rule and specificity. 
- Color and border properties are not inherited by the children, but font is, within the body element. 

### ***All About Color in CSS***

- You can choose a specific color using a hex code, RGB values, or actual color names.
- The background color by default is transparent. 
- CSS3 in particular has HSL colors. This includes specifications on hue, saturation, and lightness.
- Use a color picker to choose the color you want.
