# The Basics of Text Editors
### What is a text editor?

Just as it sounds like, a text editor is a computer software that you can download to write and edit text. For example, Microsfot Word is a basic text editor - a word processor. In the world of web development, different text editors are used that are specifically for code - which is different from the "what you see is what you get" style of word processing software.
